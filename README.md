## Contributions 
This is just a simple python program that demonstrates how different components can be combined to create a virtual assistant.
A lot can be done with this project, such as:

Adding AIML to this project to make it work like an AI Chatbot.

Using NLP for intent extraction to give it an Alexa or Google Home like intelligence. 

Feel free to fork this project and make your own changes too.
